\# Overview

Our mission is to fund and accelerate Vibe Coding apps leveraging Blockchain technology.

Whether you are a solo coder, indie hacker, web2 developer, web3 builder, or no-code creator, if you can build an app using AI tools, you can apply and launch with us.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# What is a Vibecoin?

Vibecoin is not just a narrative, Vibecoins are utility tokens launched by projects built with Vibe Coding AI-assisted tools.

Vibecoins are sector agnostic. Whether the product is DeFi, Gaming, AI, DePin, Infra, RWA, or simply entertaining enough to vibe, if it is built with Vibe Coding AI-assisted tools, it qualifies as a Vibecoin.

Each Vibecoin is backed by a real product, giving it direct utility from unlocking subscriptions, premium features, and governance, to benefiting from buyback mechanisms funded by product-generated revenue.

Vibecoins are launched through Seedify’s vibe/vibe Launchpad, using a bonding curve model for transparent price discovery, fair distribution, and instant liquidity. Milestone-based DAO funding ensures teams stay accountable, delivering continuous growth, adoption, and value creation over time.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Why Now?

There are simply not enough products that people use in web3 and Vibe Coding tools are transforming how products are built, lowering the barrier to entry and enabling creators to develop applications at a fraction of the time and cost. These AI-assisted workflows will continue to accelerate innovation, bringing more usable, consumer-facing products into web3. The industry urgently needs applications that people can actually use, and Vibecoins are the mechanism to make that adoption happen. This is why we established Seedify as The Launchpad for Vibecoins, to fund, accelerate, and scale the next generation of web3-ready products.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*Why is it important?\*\*

Your pitch can be the deciding factor in whether a Vibecoin gets Seedify Curation or moves through the Community Voting route. The community will be present during these sessions, and your presentation will play an important role in shaping the final community voting decision.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Frequency

Seedify X Streams are initially planned to occur bi-weekly. As the program evolves and more projects join, we may host them more frequently.

\# Vibecoins Key Parameters

\*\*\*

While community-voted Vibecoins will follow fixed, standard tokenomics models, Seedify-curated Vibecoins will feature customizable tokenomics tailored to each project’s specific needs. This approach allows us to support a wider range of projects while ensuring every Vibecoin has the opportunity to successfully kick off its operations.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Community Voted Vibecoins

\# Milestone-Based DAO Vesting

A milestone-based DAO vesting structure ensures that projects stay accountable and deliver on their commitments. It aligns funding with real progress, keeping teams motivated and communities engaged. This approach builds trust and rewards consistent growth over time.\\  
\\  
Also let's funding flow into the right projects who are really building, and helps the community feel that trust environment to back new vibe-coded products.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Team Funding & Milestone-Based DAO Vesting

Funding is structured to ensure accountability and continuous delivery:

\* Initial release of 20% at Token Generation Event (TGE)  
\* Four milestones of 20% each, unlocked only after DAO approval  
  \* Each milestone period is 1 month, making the full vesting schedule TGE \+ 4 months

The DAO will do monthly evaluations for each milestone based on project progress across key performance areas, including:

\* Social engagement growth  
\* Consistent communication and community updates  
\* Roadmap Progress  
  \* Product updates or new feature releases  
  \* GitHub code updates  
  \* Token integration into the product  
  \* Completion of security audits  
\* User growth metrics  
\* Revenue growth (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Rules

\#\#\#\# Basic

\* All milestones must be approved by the DAO for fund release  
\* Missing a milestone forfeits the related vesting tranche  
\* No partial unlocks for partially completed milestones

\#\#\#\# Transparency

\* Each milestone requires public updates across official channels  
\* The DAO will decide whether a milestone is achieved based on verifiable proof  
  \* Evaluation question: Has the project shown enough progress?  
    \* Yes → Vesting tranche is released  
    \* No → Vesting tranche is forfeited

\#\#\#\# Alignment with Product Growth

\* Milestones are designed to drive product delivery, adoption, monetization, and community health

\*\*\*

\*\*\*Note\*\*: Manipulating or faking metrics will result in forfeiting the related vesting tranche. This milestone-based DAO Vesting system is subject to improvements.\*

\# Managing Your Community

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Key Practices

\#\#\#\# Celebrate milestones publicly

Share progress updates, launches, and achievements with your community. Public celebration creates excitement and reinforces trust in your project.

\#\#\#\# Involve users in product decisions

Host polls, AMAs, or open discussions to give your community a voice in shaping features, priorities, and future plans. This strengthens engagement and ownership.

\#\#\#\# Gather real-time feedback from holders and users

Actively monitor feedback channels such as Telegram and X. Use community insights to improve your product quickly and stay aligned with user needs.

\# Vibecoins Flywheel

Vibecoins create a positive feedback loop that strengthens $SFUND, successful projects, and the entire Seedify ecosystem. This cycle is designed to align incentives between builders, the community, and the protocol itself.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# How the Flywheel Works

1\. \*\*Pairing with $SFUND\*\*\\  
   Every Vibecoin launched through Seedify’s vibe/vibe Launchpad is paired with $SFUND for liquidity. This creates constant demand for $SFUND as new projects enter the ecosystem.  
2\. \*\*Token Utility and Adoption\*\*\\  
   Projects integrate their Vibecoins into their apps for subscriptions, premium access, and buybacks. As adoption grows, Vibecoins demand increases, benefiting both the project and the $SFUND liquidity pool.  
3\. \*\*Milestone-based DAO Vesting\*\*\\  
   Team funds are released in tranches tied to real product and growth milestones. This ensures accountability and rewards consistent delivery.  
4\. \*\*Burning Non-Achieved Milestones\*\*\\  
   Any $SFUND from missed milestones is permanently locked in smart contracts, reducing supply. This deflationary mechanism strengthens $SFUND’s and Vibecoins long-term value.  
5\. \*\*Ecosystem Growth\*\*\\  
   Successful projects bring in new users, investors, and builders. Their growth feeds back into Seedify's network, attracting more quality projects to launch through the Vibecoin model.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# The Result

A self-sustaining growth loop where each new launch, each new user, and each successful milestone contributes to the strength of $SFUND, the success of projects, and the health of the entire Seedify ecosystem.

\# vibe/vibe Launchpad

Seedify's vibe/vibe Launchpad is the mechanism through which Vibecoins are sold and priced before reaching the open market. It ensures fair price discovery, rewards early supporters, and provides instant liquidity at launch.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Unique Features

\* Whitelisting and exclusive guaranteed tiered access to prevent automated sniping and unfair liquidity grabs\\  
  a) $SFUND Tiers\\  
  b) Seedify Social Score users\\  
  c) InfoFi users  
\* Refund mechanism during the bonding curve process for enhanced participant confidence  
\* Multi-chain support (Base, BNB, AVAX and ETH)

\#\#\# How It Works

1\. \*\*Starting Price\*\*\\  
   The curve begins at a fixed low price per token, allowing early backers to secure tokens at the best possible rate.  
2\. \*\*Price Progression\*\*\\  
   Each token purchase moves the price slightly higher along the curve. This creates an incentive for early participation and rewards those who join first.  
3\. \*\*Funding Goals\*\*\\  
   The curve continues until the project reaches its soft or hard cap. Once reached, token sales end and liquidity is prepared for the DEX listing.  
4\. \*\*Instant Liquidity\*\*\\  
   At the end of the curve, a portion of the raised $SFUND is paired with the project’s token and added to liquidity pools, ensuring immediate tradability.  
5\. \*\*Fair Launch & Transparency\*\*\\  
   All transactions, prices, and caps are transparent and verifiable on-chain, ensuring trust between the team and the community.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Benefits

\* Early backers rewarded with lower entry prices  
\* Organic price discovery based on demand  
\* Guaranteed liquidity post-launch  
\* Long-term alignment between project and community

\# Legal Tips

When launching a Vibecoin, it is important to follow guidelines that help reduce legal risks and keep your project focused on utility and community value. These tips are for general guidance only and are not legal advice.

\*\*\*

\#\#\# Key Points

\* Your token should be treated as digital merchandise, not equity  
\* Do not promise or imply profits, dividends, or any form of returns to holders  
\* Avoid presenting your token as an investment offer; focus on its utility and community benefits  
\* Follow standard market rules on information disclosure and avoid sharing non-public information for trading purposes

\*\*\*

\*\*\*Note\*\*:\*&\#x20;

\* \*Founders will need to pass KYC with Seedify\*  
\* \*For specific compliance requirements in your region, consult a qualified legal professional\*
